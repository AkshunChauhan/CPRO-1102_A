- **Usage:**
  - It defines the general styling, layout, and appearance of the blog and contact us pages.
  - Elements in both `blog.html` and `contact_us.html` are styled and designed using rules defined in `dis.css`.

### 2. ass22Dis.css

- **Purpose:** `ass22Dis.css` is specifically created for Question 1.

- **Usage:**
